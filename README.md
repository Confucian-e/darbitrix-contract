# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```

Arbitrage Contract has beed deployed to [0xC4d9eAd448B7f7F77963B17C6e2f5BcAb8871F86](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xC4d9eAd448B7f7F77963B17C6e2f5BcAb8871F86) and verified.
